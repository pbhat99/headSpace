Put the ¡°WelcomeScreen_v1.1¡± folder in plugin path of nuke(For example, on my computer I put it in ¡°C:\Users\john\.nuke¡±) and add the following line into the ¡°init.py¡±:

nuke.pluginAddPath('WelcomeScreen_v1.1')


By default it should be in .nuke folder but if you put it in another folder, please change the path of ¡°Home_Path¡± and ¡°Users_Path¡± in ¡°welcome_path.py¡±.
