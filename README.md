# pb.nuke
This includes various pythhon tools & nuke Grizmos to work as a efficient compositor.
All tools are tested on nukex 12 & nukex14 on windows 11 OS environment.
Some of the tools & Grizmos are tweaked for my needs & ease of use from my perspective.
I will try to keep it updated when the new version of tool is released.
Most of the tools are sourced from [Nukepedia.com ](https://www.nukepedia.com/) & I dont own them.
